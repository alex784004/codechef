neural network:-
the neural network have the ability to learn by example , which makes them very flexible and powerful.
For neural networks, there is no need to devise an algorithm to perform a specific task
there is no need to understand the internal mechanism of that task.

... a neural network is a system composed of many simple processing 
elements operating in parallel whose function is determined by 
network structure, connection strengths, and the processing 
performed at computing elements or nodes.  



artificial neural network:-

advantage of ann:-
1)adaptive learning :-An ANN is endowed with the ability to learn how to do taSks based on the data given
for training or initial experience
